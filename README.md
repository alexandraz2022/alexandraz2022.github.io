# NER Models for Aerospace Intelligence

# Deep Learning Models in Colombian Military Context

#### Colombian Aeroespace Force, Universidad de los Andes, Florida State University


## Abstract
An empirical study conducted on two datasets related to the Colombian
Aerospace Force, aiming to evaluate the performance of three deep learning models in extracting
entities from documents written in Spanish. We used models with transformers and convolutional
architectures to compare their performance in the Precision, Recall, and F1 Metrics. Our
findings indicate that the models under study, which were initially designed for NER tasks,
exhibited limitations when applied off-the-shelf. However, after fine-tuning, their performance
increased considerably, making them useful in military contexts with aerospace technology for
extracting valuable information from large volumes of data.

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Toyota Financial Services (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Uncovered and corrected missing step in production data pipeline which impacted over 70% of active accounts
- Redeveloped loan originations model which resulted in 50% improvement in model performance and saving 1 million dollars in potential losses

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Models 
### BERT
[Dataset 1](https://thesoftwaredesignlab.github.io)
[Dataset 2](https://thesoftwaredesignlab.github.io)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Flair
[Dataset 1](https://thesoftwaredesignlab.github.io)
[Dataset 2](https://thesoftwaredesignlab.github.io)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
